- Is versioned and all discussion and history preserved

The documentation is written in markdown, please store any assets sucn as images in the `assets` folder.

You are also encouraged to use tools like [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) to create diagrams and flowcharts.

## TODO

- [ ] Move over the ADRs from Notion
